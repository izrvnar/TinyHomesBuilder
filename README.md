# Tiny Homes Builder 

The purpose of this application was to help educate users build their very own tiny house. Building a house can be a daunting task, so this application goes step by step, finding builders for the user to contact, booking a stay to try one out and much more. 



## Custom Hook

The custom hook for the application is an energy calculator that allows the user to input all the appliances in their house and calculates how much solar panels are needed for the build. 

A motion layout was used for the dashboard that moves upwards when the user clicks it. 

The user is also able to choose which solar panels they wish to use. There are two standards, 150w and 370w which changed the number needed. 

Implementing a custom dialog and passing the information between two fragments provided a challenge. As much of the documentation is passing information between a fragment and an activity
